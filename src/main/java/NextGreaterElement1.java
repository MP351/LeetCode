/**
 *  You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2.
 *  Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.
 *
 * The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/
 *
 * No, it's asking you to take an element in the first array and then find the same element in the second array and then
 * look to the right in the second array to find a greater one. I couldn`t understand this until
 * I looked into some solutions in the discussion, either. And the examples provided by this question are not explanatory at all.
